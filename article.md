# The "console" Module

Anyone familiar with browser-side development has probably used `console.log` for debugging purposes - Node.js has implemented a built-in `console` object to mimic much of this experience.  Since we're working server-side, however, it wraps `stdout`, `stdin`, and `stderr` instead of the browser's debugging console.

Because of this browser parallel, the `console` module has become home to quite a bit of Node's standard output functionality.  The simplest is `console.log()`.

     console.log('Hi, everybody!');
     console.log('This script is:', __filename);
     console.log(__filename, process.title, process.argv);

The first, simplest example just prints the provided string to `stdout`.  It can also be used to output the contents of variables, as evidenced in #2; furthermore, `console.dir()` is called on any objects passed in as arguments, enumerating their properties.

NODE.JS PRO TIP:
`console.log()` accepts three format characters, `%s`, `%d`, and `%j`.  These format characters can be used to insert string, integer, or JSON data into your output - the order of format characters must match the order of arguments.

     var name = 'Harry',
         number = 17,
         myObj = {
           propOne: 'stuff',
           propTwo: 'more stuff'
         };
     console.log('My name is %s, my number is %d, my object is %j', name, number, myObj);

A gotcha with `console.log`, and all functions that depend on it, is that it buffers the output. So if your process ends suddenly, whether it be from an exception or from `process.exit()`, it is entirely possible that the buffered output will never reach the screen. This can cause a great deal of frustration, so watch out for this unfortunate situation.

## Console Error

`console.error()` works the same as `console.log`, except that the output is sent to `stderr` instead of `stdout`.  This is actually an extremely important difference, as `stderr` is always written to synchronously.  Any use of `console.error`, or any of the other functions in Node.js core that write to `stderr`, will block your process until the output has all been written.  This is useful for error messages - you get them exactly when they occur - but if used everywhere, can greatly slow down your process.

## Inspecting

`console.dir()`, as mentioned above, is an alias for `util.inspect()` - it is used to enumerate object properties.  [Read More](/articles/getting-started/how-to-use-util-inspect)

## Timer

That covers the basic `console` module functionality, but there are a few other methods worth mentioning as well.  First, the `console` module allows for the marking of time via `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()`.  Here is an example:

     console.time('myTimer');
     var string = '';
     for (var i = 0; i < 300; i++) {
       (function (i) {
         string += 'aaaa' + i.toString();
       })(i);
     }
     console.timeEnd('myTimer');

This would determine the amount of time taken to perform the actions in between the `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` calls.

## Printing a Stack Trace

One last function worth mentioning is `console.trace()`, which prints a stack trace to its location in your code without throwing an error.  This can occasionally be useful if you'd like to figure out where a particular failing function was called from.
